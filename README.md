# Crime Safety Analysis and Forecasting

This is a project that focuses on analyzing crime safety in different regions and forecasting future crime rates using ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model from Statsmodel library. The project has been deployed using Streamlit library for building interactive web applications.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical crime rates for various regions. The dataset has been cleaned and processed for analysis.
Features

This application allows users to:

    Analyze crime safety in different regions
    Forecast future crime rates using ARIMA model
    Visualize historical and forecasted crime rates using charts

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

    Streamlit
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Statsmodel

## Usage

To run the application, simply execute the streamlit run crime_safety_analysis.py command in the command prompt or terminal. This will launch the application in your default web browser.

From there, you can select a region of interest and analyze the historical crime rates. You can also use the ARIMA model to forecast future crime rates for the selected region.
